## Ling Xiao

From June 2020 to now, I am a Project Researcher at Computer Vision and Media Lab, The University of Tokyo (東京大学), Japan. In Dec.2020, I received Ph.D. at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (华中科技大学). My research interests focus on anomaly dignosis, representation learning, fashion recommendation, and intelligent manufacturing.
